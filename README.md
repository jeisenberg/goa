Go App engine plus
==================

## Description:

Go app engine plus is a package made to help developers build web applications on Google App Engine using go. It has 4 main purposes:

1. Add 'automatic' support for a caching layer.
2. Keep the Id of an entity on the entity itself, as opposed to separate from that entity, which is how the datastore defaults 
3. Allow developers to perform basic Read/Write/Delete functions to the datastore/memcache services in fewer lines of code
4. Allow support for callbacks on read/write of entites to datastore

### Built-in memcache

### Entity's and Keys

### CRUD Methods

### Callbacks
